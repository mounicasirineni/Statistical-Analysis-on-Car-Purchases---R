## Overview

Conducted comprehensive statistical analysis on car purchase behavior using regression modeling in R as part of the Statistics for Management course. Identified key factors influencing consumer buying decisions through hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and multiple regression techniques.

**Course:** IDS 570 - Statistics for Management  
**Technologies:** R, ggplot2, dplyr, Statistical Modeling

## Technical Approach

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded and cleaned car purchase dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Created summary statistics and distributions
- Identified outliers and missing values

### 2. Statistical Analysis

**Multiple Linear Regression:**
- Built regression model with multiple predictors
- Assessed variable significance using t-tests and p-values
- Evaluated overall model fit using R-squared and adjusted R-squared
- Interpreted coefficients for business insights

**Hypothesis Testing:**
- Tested significance of individual predictors
- Conducted F-tests for overall model significance
- Analyzed residuals for model assumptions

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Calculated correlation matrix for all variables
- Identified multicollinearity issues
- Selected independent variables for final model

### 3. Model Validation
- Checked regression assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity)
- Analyzed residual plots
- Performed cross-validation
- Tested for outliers and influential points

### 4. Visualization
- Created scatter plots with regression lines
- Generated residual plots
- Built correlation heatmaps
- Developed box plots for categorical variables

## Results

- **Achieved R-squared of 0.78** for purchase likelihood prediction
- **Identified top factors:** Price, brand reputation, fuel efficiency, safety ratings
- **Found significant demographic influences:** Age, income, family size
- **Validated model assumptions** through residual analysis

**Key Insights:**
- Price showed strongest negative correlation with purchase probability
- Brand loyalty significantly influenced purchasing decisions
- Fuel efficiency became more important for higher-income buyers
- Safety ratings critical for family car purchases

## Key Learnings

1. **Statistical Inference:** Understanding p-values, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing
2. **Regression Assumptions:** Importance of validating linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity
3. **Multicollinearity:** Detecting and handling correlated predictors
4. **Model Interpretation:** Translating coefficients into business-actionable insights
5. **R Programming:** Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling in R

## Academic Context

This project was part of **IDS 570: Statistics for Management** at UIC, completed in **Fall 2014** during my first semester of the Master's program. These foundational statistical methods—regression, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis—remain essential for data-driven decision making and form the basis for understanding more complex machine learning models.
